# MongoDB Installation 
## Download the msi file based on your platform(windows, mac, linux etc) [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
## Install
* Select the latest version and click download.
* After downloding the file double click it, and install it in complete mode.
* Note the data directory I recommend you not to change and keep it default.
* Uncheck Install mongodb compass, we don't need it for now.
* Click Install now. 

## Configure
After successfully installing the latest version you need to configure the database to use it.

* Navigate to your C:// drive or /home in linux 
* Create a folder and name it "data" (make sure to name it exactly)
* Now make another folder inside this folder named "db" (make sure to name it exactly)
The path should now appear like this:
### C:\data\db
Now set alias to your database based on your database directory in your C drive.
* cd ~ 
* touch .bash_profile
* now open this bash file and set alias (mongo = "just paste the directory")


Here is the official document which guide you step by step for installing mongoDB locally.
